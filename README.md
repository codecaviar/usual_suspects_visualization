# The Usual Suspects: Where to Find Beautiful Evidence in Data

**Code Caviar Story**: https://www.bingyune.com/blog/usual-suspects-visualization  

## Project Overview

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. Visualizations are the fastest way for humans to analyze and absorb information. Edward Tufte, one of the most prominent thinkers in the information design field, said, "The goal of information design is to convey the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space." Tufte suggested four main principles of design: 1) show data (focus on the main goal); 2) use labels (but not too many); 3) avoid chartjunk (label some but not all data points); and 4) maximize data-ink (use color carefully and strategically). Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data, with the creation of visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps.

**The goal of this project is to provide a Do-It-Yourself Guide on the main hacking skills needed to create beautiful data visuals in Python.** Data visualizations in Python can be done using many different libraries. This guide will focus on the matplotlib library, which is the oldest and most widely-used Python library for data visualization. Matplotlib is designed to work with other Python libraries such as NumPy (a numerical mathematics library) and pandas (a "wrapper" for matplotlib). The project also makes use of data scraped from the Internet Movie Database [(IMDb)](https://www.imdb.com/), which is a collection of film information and reviews. The dataset contains more than 950 top-ranking movies from various genres. It also includes attribute values for title, data, duration, content rating, headlining actors, and ranking.

## Summary:

Matplotlib is a 2-D plotting library that helps in visualizing figures.
* Bar graphs are the most commonly used types of graph because they are simple to create and easy to interpret.
* Pie charts display information as a percentage of a whole (distribution of items within the same category).
* Lie chart is used to visualize the value of something over time, such as single function y=f(x).
* Histograms display the shape and spread of continuous data using bars of different heights.
* Scatter plots are generated by mapping numeric values to a pair of perpendicular axes.
* Box (and whisker) plots are used to summarize the distribution of  data samples (especially for unknown or unusual distributions).

Data visualization is one type of visual art that peaks our interest and focuses our eyes on the message. As humans, if we can see something, we internalize it quickly. It’s storytelling with a purpose. Thus, the better you can tell a story with data, whether in a dashboard or on chart in a slide deck, the better you can leverage the information to make good decisions. Here are three best practices for storytelling with data:

    1. **Rewrite the problem statement or hypothesis.** This is your problem statement or hypothesis, reworded in a way that makes sense to your audience (hence, why it’s important to understand who they are and what they want).
    2. **Present the conclusion or result of your analysis** and how it addressed the original problem. Paint a picture of what the “world” is like before your analysis. This is the “Once upon a time...” part; the “In a world...” part. Every story needs a hero. Who/what is impacted? How can they help you explain your data better than numbers can? The results of the analysis and your action-oriented recommendation.
    3. **Connect the dots/next steps.** What happened (aka, your data analysis). Be careful not to get caught up in detailing every step of your workflow. Of course, it all feels important to you — just remember who you’re talking to and what matters to your audience.

## Getting Started

Cloning the git repository and installing the provided packages will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. The analysis for this project was performed using Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and the packages were managed using the Anaconda platform.

```
git clone https://github.com/codecaviar/usual_suspects_visualization.git
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

File Description:
* environment.yml - packages used to perform this analysis   
* notebook_usual_suspects_visualization.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for this project including data wrangling and exploratory data analysis
* imdb_1000.csv - contains more than 950 top-ranking movies of various genres from the IMBD website
